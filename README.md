# Hello, I'm Anssi Peltola! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer based in Tampere, Finland, with a diverse background in full-stack development and a passion for delivering innovative solutions. I enjoy building projects that range from full-stack web applications to game development, and I'm always eager to learn and apply new technologies. 

## About Me

After years of experience in the culinary industry, I transitioned into software development and never looked back. I have hands-on experience with a wide range of modern technologies in both frontend and backend development.

Currently, I'm focusing on developing a recipe-sharing platform that allows users to create, modify, and share their favorite recipes. My experience includes working on various personal projects, internships, and client work, giving me a strong foundation in creating scalable and responsive web applications.
